This is a GitHub archive for solvers and solutions of the low autocorrelation binary sequence (labs) problem. 
It represents a testbed for conducting rigorous, transparent, and replicable/reproducible performance testing of
labs solvers. Maintained by Borko Bošković, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
University of Maribor.

The minimization of the autocorrelation (energy) function, or equivalently the maximization of the binary 
sequence merit factor, has important applications in communication engineering. To physicists, the optimum
solution of the labs problem corresponds to the ground state of a generalized one-dimensional Ising spin system
with long range 4-spin interactions, also known as the Bernasconi model with **aperiodic autocorrelation**. 
Finding optimum sequences of the labs problem is significantly harder than solving the Ising spin-glass problems
with limited interaction and periodic boundary conditions. 

In fact, the runtime asymptotic complexity of the labs problem is much harder than the Optimal Golomb Ruler problem
that continues to be solved under massively parallel computation for the past few decades 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Golomb_ruler and http://www.distributed.net/OGR).
