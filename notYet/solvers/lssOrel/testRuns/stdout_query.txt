$ ./lssOrel 
Usage: ./lssOrel Lodd [options]

Lodd                  ... odd number, denoting the length of the binary string

Options:
-runtimeLmt seconds   ... stop after this number of seconds; default = 300.
                          (this can be overruled if cntProbeLmt below is enabled)
-valueTarget energy   ... stop when this level of energy is reached;
                          default = best known energy value.
-laevus number        ... functionFactor as well as functionParameter.
                          The laevus value represents the number of 0 bits at the left end
                          of full binary string; default = 0.
                          NOTE: since this solver runs under the assumption of skew-symmetry,
                                the effective dimension of the search space is reduced to
                                      nDim = (Lodd + 1)/2 - laevus
                                which now controls the values of solver parameters.
-walkSegmCoef val     ... solverFactor, a coefficient that controls walk segment length;
                          default = 8 implies walk segment length value of 8*(Lodd + 1)/2 - laevus
                          value   = U implies walk segment length value of 2^((Lodd + 1)/2 - laevus - 1)
                              (2 GB memory is required when (Lodd + 1)/2 - laevus  = 53)
-seed s1,s2,s3        ... three **short** integers separated by commas, to initialize
                          the random number generator; default = 1,2,3.
-coordInit bitString  ... initial binary string,
                          default = a random binary string, determined by seed.
-v                    ... turn on the verbose output.
-help                 ... display this help and exit.
